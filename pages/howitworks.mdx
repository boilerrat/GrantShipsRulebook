# How Grant Ships Works

The game begins with the election and funding of 6 Grant Ships and a small Referee Team.
At the beginning of each funding season, the Grant Ships are given capital from a common funding pool. For the bulk of each season, Grant Ships are busy screening applications, distributing funds, and reporting results. At the end of each season, each ship produces a Portfolio Report to communicate its progress. 
The Arbitrum community then ranks the Grant Ships through a weighted token vote. In the following season, high-performing Ships receive a larger portion of the funding pool, and lower-performing ships receive less.

Inactive Ships or Ships that fail to meet minimum criteria can be replaced by new teams looking to enter the game.
The Referee Team facilitates the game and monitors the Ships' compliance with reporting requirements by flagging rule violations.
