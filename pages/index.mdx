# Welcome To Grant Ships

Grant Ships is an 'evolutionary grants game' where Grant Ships (grant-giving subDAOs) compete to best deploy capital within the Arbitrum ecosystem.
The goal is to continually improve how capital is allocated by learning which Ship models are most effective, who the talented actors are, and which allocations resonate with voters.
